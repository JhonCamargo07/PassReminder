# PassReminder

Is a password reminder tool, which helps us to save all the passwords of different sites and store them in a database with good security.

#### Features:

-   Has good security
-   Allows you to create multiple users
-   It allows us to add passwords infinite times
-   The data can only be seen by the user who created it

**Important aspects**

-   The project is still being created, it may have some errors in its execution, the tests that were done on it allow us to know that this software works in a good way
-   As the software is under development, its visual appearance may not be as comfortable, but we will work to solve it and be able to expand it and publish it on the web
-   The software is free, that is, open source
